# Predicting-Student-Proficiency

This was my senior thesis titled 'Supervised Machine Learning to Predict Student Proficiency'. 

Abstract: 
The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires all states to annually measure the academic performance of public schools in the United States, including Oregon. One critical metric of school performance is the ”percentage proficient” score, which measures the percentage of students who achieve proficiency in English Language arts (ELA) and Math standardized tests for the 2018-19 year. This thesis compares the use of random forest models and decision trees to predict student proficiency for Oregon public schools using various student and school information. These variables include gender, ethnicity, faculty resources, and others. By comparing random forests and decision trees we aim to provide models that are both interpretable and accurate.
